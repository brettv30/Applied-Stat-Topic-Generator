# Applied-Stat-Topic-Generator

Here's a small python program I created that has a dictionary of all topics I studied in my Applied Statistics course. In order to keep my stats skills polished, I decided to create a program that would give out a different topic each time the program is ran. Once a topic is received, the user must go out and find a problem related to the topic, then solve that problem and check it against a given solution. 

List of all topics in the program:

**1:** Two-Tailed T-test of Correlation Significance 

**2:**  Discrete Binomial Probability 

**3:**  Estimation of Population Means 

**4:**  Two-tailed T-test of Sample means assuming Equal Variance 

**5:**  Two-tailed T-test of Sample means assuming Unequal Variance 

**6:**  Two-tailed T-test of Sample means using Matched Pair Design 

**7:**  Chi-Squared 

**8:**  Poisson Distribution 

**9:**  Simple Linear Regression 

**10:** Multiple Linear Regression 

**11:**  Simple Logistics Regression 

**12:**  Multiple Logistics Regression 

**13:**  Estimation of Values 

**14:**  Backwards Stepwise Regression 

**15:**  Wilcoxon Rank-Sum
