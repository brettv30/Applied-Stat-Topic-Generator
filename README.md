# Random-Applied-Stats-Topic-Generator

Here's a small program I created that has a dictionary of all topics I studied this past semester in my Applied Statistics course. I want to keep my stats skills strong over the summer so I decided to create a program that I could access every day which would give me a different topic every time I run the program. Once I receive a topic, it is my job to go out and find a problem (with a solution), then solve that problem and check it against the given solution. 

I've been using this over the last month and I've found it very beneficial to my learning of different Applied Statistics topics. Hopefully it can help others master these topics as well!

Here's a list of all topics in the program:

1: Two-Tailed T-test of Correlation Significance
2: Discrete Binomial Probability
3: Estimation of Population Means
4: Two-tailed T-test of Sample means assuming Equal Variance
5: Two-tailed T-test of Sample means assuming Unequal Variance
6: Two-tailed T-test of Sample means using Matched Pair Design
7: Chi-Squared
8: Poisson Distribution
9: Simple Linear Regression
10: Multiple Liner Regression
11: Simple Logistics Regression
12: Multiple Logistics Regression
13: Estimation of Values
14: Backwards Stepwise Regression
15: Wilcoxon Rank-Sum
