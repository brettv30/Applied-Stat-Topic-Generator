# Random-Applied-Stats-Topic-Generator

Here's a small program I created that has a dictionary of all topics I covered this past semester in Applied Statistics. I want to keep my stats skills strong over the summer so I decided to create a program that I could access every day which would give me a different topic every time I run the program. Once I receive a topic, it is my job to go out and find a problem (with a solution), then solve that problem and check it against the given solution.
